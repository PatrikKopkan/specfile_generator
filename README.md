# specfile_generator

Goal is automate making of specfiles of python packages on pypi for Fedora.

## Dependencies

In order to run the specfile generator, you will need this dependencies installed

* Python >= 3.5
* Python modules:
    * jinja2
    * requests

In Fedora, all dependencies can be installed via dnf: `sudo dnf install python3-jinja2 python3-requests`. Or you can install dependencies via pip into virtual environment.

## usage
~~~~
usage: gen_spec [-h] [--version VERSION] [--debug] package

positional arguments:
  package            name of package stored in pypi

optional arguments:
  -h, --help         show this help message and exit
  --version VERSION  version of package, default is the newest version
  --debug            specfile will contain more information,
                     for now it writes to spec list of all files gotten from virtual environment
                
~~~~

### Generate specfile

```
$ python3 gen_spec requests
```
~~~
$ cat requests.spec

%global pkgname requests

Requests is the only *Non-GMO* HTTP library for Python, safe for human
consumption.

Behold, the power of Requests:

``` {.sourceCode .python}
>>> import requests
>>> r = requests.get('https://api.github.com/user', auth=('user', 'pass'))
>>> r.status_code
200
>>> r.headers['content-type']
'application/json; charset=utf8'
>>> r.encoding
'utf-8'
>>> r.text
u'{"type":"User"...'
>>> r.json()
{u'disk_usage': 368627, u'private_gists': 484, ...}
```

Requests allows you to send *organic, grass-fed* HTTP/1.1 requests,
without the need for manual labor. There's no need to manually add query
strings to your URLs, or to form-encode your POST data. Keep-alive and
HTTP connection pooling are 100% automatic, thanks to
[urllib3](https://github.com/shazow/urllib3).

Besides, all the cool kids are doing it. Requests is one of the most
downloaded Python packages of all time, pulling in over 11,000,000
downloads every month. You don't want to be left out!

### Build source and binary RPM
[rpm guide](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/How_to_create_a_GNU_Hello_RPM_package)  
[simpler Fedora specific guide](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/creating-rpm-packages/)

### What do we do

For now we get information from pypi. Then install package to virtual environment to get list of files and we
merge them. The preparation of build dependencies is handled by [Fedora macros](https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/pyproject-rpm-macros).
